# in the **INDEX** branch, i want to implement:

- [ ] quote of the day on the splash page:
- [x] qotd displayed in div .quote 
	* (future release) - add scrollbar so i can read more quotes, as desired?? will this functionality be useful in increasing motivation or be a distraction to getting started?
- [ ] add <a> next quote </a>
	- [x]1b. add the ability to add a new quote - @app.route('/add_quote')


- [ ] collapsible list of daily desires/habits
- [ ] the list should be of each habit i want to build, e.g.
	- [ ] Bullet Journal/To-Do lists
		* what's on today's docket?
		* what did i accomplish today + reflection
		* make tomorrow's to-do list
	- [ ] Study:
		* khanacademy (10 min)
		* duolingo (5-10 min)
		* codingdojo and/or some language docs (30-240 min)
	- [ ] First you get the money:
		* upwork
		* craigslist
		* preferred companies
		* etc
	- [ ] Calories:
		* food tracke
			* (future release) - import food tracker from ap
		* pick tomorrow's meal
			* (future release) - pick 2-3 days out, 1 week out


- [ ] add a table that shows me how many days in a row i've been touching this area of my life,
	* like one of those "it has been ___ days since our last accident" boards in warehouses/factories.
		* column 1: area of life
		* column 2: days in a row
		* column 3: days total
		* column: 4 days since start;


- [ ] dude, in developing rBP, it's ok to draw. drawing out what you want your site to look like is just as important as writing the code. it gives you a chance to see what you want your mvp to look like; it's like reverse-engineering the lego model.
	* figure out the output that i want.
	* then you can look at the input that you have/need.
	* then you figure out how to change the input (user interface - how to arrange/collect) to the output.
