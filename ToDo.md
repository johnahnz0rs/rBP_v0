# in the **INDEX** branch, i want to implement:

- [ ] __Health__ section > __Diet__ subsection
	- [ ] __Foods I Like__
		- [ ] keep a database of recipes that i like
		- [ ] rating system? so rBP knows my preferences
	- [ ] __Repertoire__
		- [ ]depending on what i've been eating, i want rBP to tell me what to cook and eat next. e.g. if ive been eating alot of chicken, i want rBP to tell me to switch it up before i get tired of chicken.
	- [ ] __Healthy Alternatives to Cravings__
		- [ ] if i'm craving an unhealthy food, rBP should analyze the macros that i'm craving and recommend an alternative. e.g. if i'm craving ice cream, it tells me to eat nuts instead or an avocado or sherbet.





- [ ] Quotes section
	## i want the quotes to be thoughts that can change my mental pattern. i.e. we
- [ ] quote of the day on the splash page:
- [x] qotd displayed in div .quote 
	* (future release) - add scrollbar so i can read more quotes, as desired?? will this functionality be useful in increasing motivation or be a distraction to getting started?
- [ ] add <a> next quote </a>
- [x] add the ability to add a new quote - @app.route('/add_quote')


- [ ] collapsible list of daily desires/habits
- [ ] the list should be of each habit i want to build, e.g.
	- [ ] Bullet Journal/To-Do lists
		* what's on today's docket?
		* what did i accomplish today + reflection
		* make tomorrow's to-do list
	- [ ] Study:
		* khanacademy (10 min)
		* duolingo (5-10 min)
		* codingdojo and/or some language docs (30-240 min)
	- [ ] First you get the money:
		* upwork
		* craigslist
		* preferred companies
		* etc
	- [ ] Calories:
		* food tracke
			* (future release) - import food tracker from ap
		* pick tomorrow's meal
			* (future release) - pick 2-3 days out, 1 week out


- [ ] add a table that shows me how many days in a row i've been touching this area of my life,
	* like one of those "it has been ___ days since our last accident" boards in warehouses/factories.
		* column 1: area of life
		* column 2: days in a row
		* column 3: days total
		* column: 4 days since start;


- [ ] dude, in developing rBP, it's ok to draw. drawing out what you want your site to look like is just as important as writing the code. it gives you a chance to see what you want your mvp to look like; it's like reverse-engineering the lego model.
	* figure out the output that i want.
	* then you can look at the input that you have/need.
	* then you figure out how to change the input (user interface - how to arrange/collect) to the output.
