# To-Do

## Research:

### [ ] https://www.clearerthinking.org/ 
* (added 3/1/18)
* Nathan thinks this might be a competitor because they also try to help the user make better decisions (see also: whatDo)

### [x] www.guidedtrack.com 
* (added 3/1/18)
* 3/2/18: 
	* I spent an hour trying to build a 'schedule ur workouts for the upcoming week' app using this website
		* you can see what i got done here: https://www.guidedtrack.com/programs/6833/edit	
	* THOUGHTS: 
		* while GT might be useful for someone who doesn't want to learn to code, i _am_ learning how to code
		* it felt like i had to learn a whole new language to write that app using GT -- and it's not even a real language; it's like a pseudo-language just for that one particular website.
		* so instead of being helpful, its propriety pseudo-language felt more like an unnecessary barrier than an aid.
		* also, because GT had to nerf the coding ability, i wasn't able to (or at least, i couldn't figure out from their docs in one hour) how to get the functionality i wanted; specifically:
			* i could only ask/answer one question at a time per page load (because that's how GT worked) instead of being able to fill out a whole form.
			* no for loops
			* no lists, dicts
			* no concatenation of variables and strings
		* i decided to abandon GT in favor writing my own full stack app, which would give me more control over functionality.

### [ ] Amazon's Alexa
* (added 3/2/18)
* It seems you can develop what are called "Alexa Skills". Here are some links

### [ ] is there an online/automated talk-therapy app?
* added 3/2/18

### [ ] how to connect apps / api's?
* added 3/2/18
	* [ ] evernote
	* [ ] myfitnesspal / myplate (livestrong)
	* [ ] iOS calendar / gcalendar

## Code:

### [ ] Schedule upcoming week's exercises
* added 3/2/18 - a la Joe Rogan's Daily Routine (https://youtu.be/14rvts7tptw)
	* [ ] auto-add to my phone/computer's calendar app(s)
		* [ ] methods: email it to myself, and manually add each event to my calendar?
		* [ ] methods: what other methods are there to add to my calendar?
	* [ ] display on rBP splash page

### [ ] Schedule upcoming week's meals
* added 3/2/18
	* [ ] add my own preferred meals
	* [ ] have rBP suggest meals based on recent past meals

### [ ] Thought Trainer (subconscious/unconscious thought)
* added 3/1/18
	* [ ] comb through 67 steps for gold nuggets
	* [ ] comb through HTWFAIP for gold nuggets

### [ ] daily to-do list
* added 3/2/18
	* [ ] force the user to make a to-do list for the next day to prime their mind for action tomorrow, and to minimize that likelihood of wasting a day
	* [ ] force the user to reflect on the good, the bad, the ugly/the great of what they did today.



<!-- - [ ] __Health__ section > __Diet__ subsection
	- [ ] __Foods I Like__
		- [ ] keep a database of recipes that i like
		- [ ] rating system? so rBP knows my preferences
	- [ ] __Repertoire__
		- [ ]depending on what i've been eating, i want rBP to tell me what to cook and eat next. e.g. if ive been eating alot of chicken, i want rBP to tell me to switch it up before i get tired of chicken.
	- [ ] __Healthy Alternatives to Cravings__
		- [ ] if i'm craving an unhealthy food, rBP should analyze the macros that i'm craving and recommend an alternative. e.g. if i'm craving ice cream, it tells me to eat nuts instead or an avocado or sherbet.





- [ ] Quotes section
	## i want the quotes to be thoughts that can change my mental pattern. i.e. we
- [ ] quote of the day on the splash page:
- [x] qotd displayed in div .quote 
	* (future release) - add scrollbar so i can read more quotes, as desired?? will this functionality be useful in increasing motivation or be a distraction to getting started?
- [ ] add <a> next quote </a>
- [x] add the ability to add a new quote - @app.route('/add_quote')


- [ ] collapsible list of daily desires/habits
- [ ] the list should be of each habit i want to build, e.g.
	- [ ] Bullet Journal/To-Do lists
		* what's on today's docket?
		* what did i accomplish today + reflection
		* make tomorrow's to-do list
	- [ ] Study:
		* khanacademy (10 min)
		* duolingo (5-10 min)
		* codingdojo and/or some language docs (30-240 min)
	- [ ] First you get the money:
		* upwork
		* craigslist
		* preferred companies
		* etc
	- [ ] Calories:
		* food tracke
			* (future release) - import food tracker from ap
		* pick tomorrow's meal
			* (future release) - pick 2-3 days out, 1 week out


- [ ] add a table that shows me how many days in a row i've been touching this area of my life,
	* like one of those "it has been ___ days since our last accident" boards in warehouses/factories.
		* column 1: area of life
		* column 2: days in a row
		* column 3: days total
		* column: 4 days since start;


- [ ] dude, in developing rBP, it's ok to draw. drawing out what you want your site to look like is just as important as writing the code. it gives you a chance to see what you want your mvp to look like; it's like reverse-engineering the lego model.
	* figure out the output that i want.
	* then you can look at the input that you have/need.
	* then you figure out how to change the input (user interface - how to arrange/collect) to the output. -->
