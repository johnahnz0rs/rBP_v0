## general thoughts
* *__rBP's main functions__* (added 3/6/18)
	* *__Thought Trainer__*
		* *What's the big idea here?*: IME, __a single shift in thought can change a life__ -- because the thoughts/story we repeat to ourselves shape our lives.
			* For example, when I changed from "It's their fault that my life's like this" to "I only have myself to blame"...
			* For example, when I changed from "Why won't she love me?" to "I'm gonna go get whoever I want"...
			* For example, when I changed from "It's too hard/I can't" to "I'm going to do this, so this is what I need to do"...
		* This can be a subtle way to introduce beneficial relationships, like:
			* Talk therapy,
			* Guided meditation,
			* Self-reflection/self-awareness

	* *__Accountabilibuddy__*
		* *What's the big idea here?*: IME, if I'm the only one who cares about something I should be working on, it's __too easy__ for me to be like "Ehhh, I'm gonna skip today". Every one of my big advances have come because someone else was there *__expecting__* me to follow through.
			* For example, Alex saved my life when we started working out together at LACC.
			* For example, I wasted less days at Hitch when Miller made me articulate what I wanted to accomplish everyday via daily EOD Reports.
			* For example, making to-do lists was an easier habit to maintain when Hanah was expecting me to forward her my to-do lists.
			* For example, I coded more consistently and persistently with Nathan sitting on Skype with me everyday.

	* *__WhatDo__* (TM Nathan)
		* *What's the big idea here?*: IME, if I leave it up to me to decide what to do next, __I will always choose poor habits like blazing up some endo and watching TV__. I.e., my mind will automatically revert back to relax mode. 
		* Why? Partially because that's human nature; and partially because *__there's too much choice__* now.
		* WhatDo helps make things easier.
			* For example, it's hard to *__pick my menu__* for the week because there's just too many choices. WhatDo will ask me simple questions to help me determine what to eat. E.g.
				* are you craving any specific foods?;
				* what are your preferences for delivery system (e.g. salads, entree plates, gluten/junk)?; etc.
			* For example, we can *__compile resources__* like 80000hours.org, clearerthinking.org, khanacademy, etc; i.e. people who have already spent considerable time creating pathways and guides. (Great artists steal :P )
			* For example, rBP can act like a *__personal assistant__* and keep me on my own schedule.
			* For example, rBP can help me *__prevent regret__*


<!-- * rBP should be a __thought trainer__ in that it puts the thoughts that are most likely to guide me towards my desired life into my head.
* rBP should be an extension of the user: __like a good assistant, it helps you__:
	* remember what you've learned/done in the past, 
	* remember what/who you'd like to become in the future, and 
	* guide your actions/decisions in the now.
* rBP should __consistently speak with the user__, creating the illusion that it is the second voice in your head.
* rBP is ultimately meant to be an actual, physical, traveling companion -- your own personal sidekick. -->

## desired output


### >>> DAILY PLANNING
* one of my biggest recurring regrets is that i wasted my day. i often think "if i had only made a to-do list, i could have gotten more done today instead of just watching tv or otherwise dicking around"
	[ ] force the user to make a to-do list for tomorrow before going to sleep
	[ ] force the user to reflect on his accomplishments/failures each day

### >>> SELF-REFLECTION
#### gain an accurate view of himself

* see yourself clearly:
* rBP should be able to show the user definitively, without judgment, and without causing offense, that you are indeed an ___ :

	* are you:
		* bitchy
		* an asshole
		* a punk ass, pussy ass bitch? 
		* a hypocrite?
		* narcissistic? (dsm 4)

			[ ] add dsm 5 NPD
		* too hard on yourself
		* too easy on yourself
		* hate your job
		* hate your partner/spouse?
		* hate your friends?



#### data visualization
* in video games, you're able to see your character's *__attributes__* and *__progress__*
	* what is important for a user to see about himself?
		[ ] health
		[ ] attractiveness
		[ ] how he treats people
		[ ] his habits
		[ ] his thoughts, what he thinks about all day
		[ ] whether his image of himself is accurate: does he over- or under-estimate himself?
		[ ] his past accomplishments

### >>> STAND ON THE SHOULDERS OF GIANTS
* we have available to us, at high speed, at little to no cost, the wisdom of so many great minds. fucking use it.

[ ] go through *__HTWFAIP__* and copy over some of his lessons.
[ ] go through the *__67 steps__* and copy over some of his lessons.
[ ] go through *__youtube videos__* and copy over motivations
[ ] favorite book *__quotes__*
[ ] favorite *__speeches & monologues__*




### >>> REMEMBER TO REMEMBER
* I often find that i backslide on progress that i've made because i simply lose sight of the importance of the lessons i've learned, and start to ignore them.
	* e.g. i learn time and time again that if i do yoga 3-7 times a week, my body starts to feel less pain (in my shoulders, lower back, legs, etc), but then i stop doing yoga after a few days. wtf mate?

* what are some of the input methods for storing lessons learned?
	[ ] written journal entries
	[ ] video journals
	[ ] user-submitted quotes from role models
	[ ] results from past experiments





### >>> rBP's "VOICE"

#### Dale Carnegie-esque
* no matter what the user's communication style, rBP should *__always be supportive in a way that best benefits the user__*.
	* e.g. i personally have a hard time taking advice of my well-intentioned parents because i often perceive them to be judgmental. i have an easier time taking advice from someone who is more detached than my parents -- someone who is offering suggestions based on their experiences/successes/failures, as opposed to my parents' orders based on their irrational fears.

#### complement the user
* who is the user? how does he speak? rBP should talk to the user in a vernacular, tone of voice, cadence, etc, that complements the user and makes him feel comfortable. rBP will eventually become the user's best friend.

* rBP should talk to the user the way the user wants:
	[ ] user's communication style
		[ ] what is the user's vernacular?
			[ ] is he a california hippie?
			[ ] is he a gruff, east coast man's man?
			[ ] is he the quiet, brooding type?
		[ ] what kind of personality does the user want rBP to have?
	[ ] what does the user need from rBP?
		[ ] does the user need someone he can delegate to, e.g. a personal assistant?
		[ ] does the user need a manager that keeps an eye on the big picture while the user creates?
		[ ] does the user need a teacher/hand-holder?








<!-- 
* Chatbot - a huge aspect of rBP is that it talks to you; it is essentially a chatbot that encourages you to improve yourself.
	* rBP should be a social chameleon and a very good reader/watcher. ie in a few chat sessions, via experimentation based on user-self-identification and mini-tests, rBP should be able to figure out: 
			* __your communication style and vernacular__ (are you a bro or a preppie or a stoner or a jock or a bad bitch or a sista or christian/muslim/upstanding citizen or a bad apple or trailer trash, and so on.) - how does the user talk to his friends? so that rBP can talk to the user in the same way.
				- [ ] what tests can help figure this out?
			* __your learning style__ (reader or listener or watcher) - what channels should rBP use to present new and reinforcing evidence to the user: youtub clips, short quotes and aphorism, book recommendations, links to articles, slideshows of the user's own recorded journal entries/video logs?
				- [ ] how did peter drucker recommend you find out?
			* your love languages
				- [ ] what was the name of that lady who listed the love languages?
					* physical touch
					* acts of service
					* words of affirmation
					* quality time
					* receiving gifts
			* your hopes and dreams and fears
			* your negative thought cycles
			* your positive trigger words/action words
			* 

* Because I am a human whose willpower and focus can wax and wane, I want rBP to be there *__to remind me of my better self__*, and *__to encourage me to EARN/DESERVE what i want__*.
* I want rBP to be:
	* __my constant companion__ (in that it's always watching me); 
	* __my conscience__ (in that it makes me own up to my decisions and actions) -- (i'm creating rBP with the assumption that everyone, like me, wants to become a good person... but if an evil person used rBP, it would be interesting to see their thought processes mapped out, you know, for science/psychology study, like looking into the mind of a madman); 
		* aka remind me of my past self's actions, and focus my attention on future goals. so that today, i can do what i need to do to get the future i want.
		* similar ideas:
			* rescue time sends you a weekly
			* stickK where u can make bets
	* __my assistant__ (in that it helps me stay on track/on schedule, thereby freeing up brainspace and/or picking up my slack); and 
		* similar ideas:
			* google calendar

	* __my friend__ (in that it doesn't judge me, but understands me and stands by me and helps me selflessly).
		* my parents are well-meaning, but they always say it to me in a judgmental way.
		* present the information in a dale carnegie-esque way, where i don't get put off by any sense of judgment, but it's just passive information presented to me.





### i want rBP to *__constantly remind me of my own stated goals__*
* this can be in the form of notes i've written myself, images of the goals i want, even videos (since everybody is different, this should be tailored to each user)



### I want rBP to *__present visualized data that irrefutably shows whether i'm living up to my own desires [or if i've been slacking]__*
* this can be percentage achieved towards a stated goal.
* this can be a current state of affairs report.
* what does this look like?
	* i want a *daily* view combined with a *weekly* view;
	* i want a *18-month* view (this is how long my __serious experiments__ should last; my __exploratory experiments__ can be anywhere from 3-30 days)
	* show me my __experiments__ (to figure out what works best for me) and my __staples__ (which i already know that i need to be doing)



### i want rBP to *__recommend what i should do next when i am dilly-dallying__*
* like a good assistant, i want rBP to know where i'm "letting the spinning dishes slow down", and tell me to pay attention to it.	
* advanced -- offer to users *further research* on this topic. i've noticed some people don't go beyond what they already know because they don't know where to go! i've been blessed in that new things/extensions of ideas keep presenting themselves to me. I think google and advertisements are very good at predicting what else would interest me, but that's for advertisements' sake -- let's do this for users with righteous ends in mind (like a benevolent tyrant might :P ).




==========================================================================
## input required:
* i need to tell rBP what my goals are (*__stated goals are a crucial input__*):
	* __Health__: 
		* __my diet__ - I've learned that the best way NOT to eat shitty foods is to always be prepared. get a little hunger pang? boom, here's something healthy -- if you leave it up to me to "figure it out" on the spot, i'm always gonna choose the shitty option. put a plate in front of me as soon as i need it or even *think* i want it.
		* __favorite activities__ - forget "working out", which many see as a chore; what did you do for fun? how do you play? (e.g. running, walking/hiking, gardening, photography, biking, martial arts, sports, dancing what are the clubs you joined as a kid/in hs or college?)
	* __Wealth__:
		* __job skillz__ - new ways to make money
		* __self-awareness__
		* __business relationships__
	* __Love__:
		* __friends__
		* __family__
		* __romance__
	* __Happiness__:
		* __celebrate your weirdness__ aka uniqueness. what do you like to do? be proud of it. find others who do that, too, and connect. nerd out, my friend.
		*
