"What we call human nature in actuality is human habit" - the poet jewel.

I was told as a young boy that the difference between a "genius" and a moron is as thin as a sheet of paper. I was also told that you become the thoughts and images you repeatedly allow into your mind. Your body becomes what you repeatedly eat and repeatedly do. And you become like the people who are repeatedly around and in your life. 

So be careful and choose wisely what you repeat.

Rather than discouraging or dissuading, these bits of knowledge make the possibilities more mouth-wateringly enticing to me. The more I know about how the myself and the game work  -- the game of Life -- the better my odds get. Alas, I am limited in will and often forgetful. I am human, an animal, a creature of the Earth.

rBP was my hypothesis.

What would happen if at EVERY moment of human fallibility, in your presence is a friend who can help you enjoy doing the things that bring us The Good Life -- of which there are Four Pillars: Health, Wealth, Love, & Happiness?

Personalized to your own communication style, motivational speech & thought patterns, love language(s), nutritional and dietary needs, physical and mental capacities -- you can choose complex accents and languages (e.g. a man speaking colloquial American with an Chinese accent, or British woman speaking Cockney English).

What *would* happen if at every moment one of our destructive habits is triggered, a friend interrupted with a better offer?

My hypothesis is that with such a friend, whoever is earnest in their desire to improve themselves and is willing to face and address simple truths (even the less flattering and sometimes painful ones), can and will eventually reach their version of The Good Life. rBP is here to help -- you can name your pal however you two see fit #freedom.
