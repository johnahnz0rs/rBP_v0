# branch 'index': i am building functionality for the index page.


# High level: output desired, input required[, processes]
## desired output:
* I want rBP to be:
	* __my constant companion__ (in that it's always watching me); 
	* __my conscience__ (in that it makes me own up to my decisions and actions) -- (i'm creating rBP with the assumption that everyone, like me, wants to become a good person... but if an evil person used rBP, it would be interesting to see their thought processes mapped out, you know, for science/psychology study, like looking into the mind of a madman); 
	* __my assistant__ (in that it helps me stay on track/on schedule, thereby freeing up brainspace and/or picking up my slack); and 
	* __my friend__ (in that it doesn't judge me, but understands me and stands by me and helps me selflessly).
* Because I am a human whose willpower and focus can wax and wane, I want rBP to be there *__to remind me of my better self__*, and *__to encourage me to EARN/DESERVE what i want__*.

### i want rBP to *__constantly remind me of my own stated goals__*
* this can be in the form of notes i've written myself, images of the goals i want, even videos (since everybody is different, this should be tailored to each user)

### I want rBP to *__present visualized data that irrefutably shows whether i'm living up to my own desires [or if i've been slacking]__*
* this can be percentage achieved towards a stated goal.
* this can be a current state of affairs report.
* what does this look like?
	* i want a *daily* view combined with a *weekly* view;
	* i want a *18-month* view (this is how long my __serious experiments__ should last; my __exploratory experiments__ can be anywhere from 3-30 days)
	* show me my __experiments__ (to figure out what works best for me) and my __staples__ (which i already know that i need to be doing)

### i want rBP to *__recommend what i should do next when i am dilly-dallying__*
* like a good assistant, i want rBP to know where i'm "letting the spinning dishes slow down", and tell me to pay attention to it.	
* advanced -- offer to users *further research* on this topic. i've noticed some people don't go beyond what they already know because they don't know where to go! i've been blessed in that new things/extensions of ideas keep presenting themselves to me. I think google and advertisements are very good at predicting what else would interest me, but that's for advertisements' sake -- let's do this for users with righteous ends in mind (like a benevolent tyrant might :P ).


## input required:
* i need to tell rBP what my goals are (*__stated goals are a crucial input__*):
	* __Health__: 
		* __my diet__ - I've learned that the best way NOT to eat shitty foods is to always be prepared. get a little hunger pang? boom, here's something healthy -- if you leave it up to me to "figure it out" on the spot, i'm always gonna choose the shitty option. put a plate in front of me as soon as i need it or even *think* i want it.
		* __favorite activities__ - forget "working out", which many see as a chore; what did you do for fun? how do you play? (e.g. running, walking/hiking, gardening, photography, biking, martial arts, sports, dancing what are the clubs you joined as a kid/in hs or college?)
	* __Wealth__:
		* __job skillz__ - new ways to make money
		* __self-awareness__
		* __business relationships__
	* __Love__:
		* __friends__
		* __family__
		* __romance__
	* __Happiness__:
		* __celebrate your weirdness__ aka uniqueness. what do you like to do? be proud of it. find others who do that, too, and connect. nerd out, my friend.
		*
