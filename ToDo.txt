# in the INDEX branch, i want to implement:

# 1. quote of the day on the splash page
	# DONE 1a. qotd displayed in div .quote
		# (future release) - add scrollbar so i can read more quotes, as desired?? will this functionality be useful in increasing motivation or be a distraction to getting started?
			# add <a> next quote </a>
	# 1b. add the ability to add a new quote - @app.route('/add_quote')


	
# 2. collapsible list of daily desires/habits
	# 2a. the list should be of each habit i want to build, e.g.
		 # - Bullet Journal/To-Do lists
		 	# - what's on today's docket?
		 	# - what did i accomplish today + reflection
		 	# - make tomorrow's to-do list
		# - Study:
		 	# - khanacademy (10 min)
		 	# - duolingo (5-10 min)
		 	# - codingdojo and/or some language docs (30-240 min)
		 # - First you get the money:
		 	# - upwork
		 	# - craigslist
		 	# - preferred companies
		 	# - etc
		 # - Calories:
		 	# - food tracker
		 		# (future release) - import food tracker from app
		 	# - pick tomorrow's meals
		 		# (future release) - pick 2-3 days out, 1 week out


# 3. add a table that shows me how many days in a row i've been touching this area of my life, 
	# like one of those ___ days since our last accident boards.
	# column 1: area of life;	column 2: days in a row;	column 3: days total	column: 4 days since start;


# 4. dude, in developing rBP, it's ok to draw. drawing out what you want your site to look like is just as important as writing the code. it gives you a chance to see what you want your mvp to look like; it's like reverse-engineering the lego model.
